| Case ID | Command / Step | Expected | Actual | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `KB6-UAT-01` | Run monitor twice to complete 4-point baseline (`python backend/scripts/kb_benchmark_monitor.py --profile prod --retain-count 10`) | At least 4 prod monitor points exist | 4 monitor points generated | `PASS` | `.runtime/kb_benchmark_history/prod/monitor_20260209T111054Z.json`, `.runtime/kb_benchmark_history/prod/monitor_20260209T111137Z.json`, `.runtime/kb_benchmark_history/prod/monitor_20260209T112125Z.json`, `.runtime/kb_benchmark_history/prod/monitor_20260209T112132Z.json` |
| `KB6-UAT-02` | Run weekly review (`python backend/scripts/kb_benchmark_review.py --profile prod --lookback 4`) | Review JSON generated with trend summary and decision | `points=4`, decision=`keep_thresholds` | `PASS` | `.runtime/kb_benchmark_reviews/prod/review_20260209T112145Z.json` |
| `KB6-UAT-03` | Verify weekly review workflow file | Weekly review workflow exists and uploads report artifact | Workflow present | `PASS` | `.github/workflows/kb-weekly-review.yml` |

## 4) Acceptance Decision

| Decision | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Go / No-Go | `Go` |
| Residual Risk | `Trend cadence baseline is available; threshold tightening still requires additional weekly evidence cycles` |
| Follow-up | `Operate weekly review and open KB-TC updates only when decision changes from keep to tighten/investigate` |
