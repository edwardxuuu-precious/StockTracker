# StockTracker QA Hub

Last updated: `2026-02-10`

## Purpose

This folder keeps active QA/UAT documents for real-usage verification and release readiness.

## Primary Documents (Keep)

- `docs/QA/README.md`
- `docs/QA/UAT_RealUsage_Log_2026-02.md`
- `docs/QA/UAT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/QA/Agent_LLM_Readiness_Checklist_2026-02-10.md`
- `docs/QA/AI_Quality_Overview_2026-02-10.md`

## Defect Tracking Rule

- Current defects/issues should be tracked in `docs/QA/UAT_RealUsage_Log_2026-02.md` (Operation Log + Day Summary).
- Historical defect sheet `UAT_FullChain_Defects_2026-02-09.md` has been archived.

## Archived In Round 2

Historical case-level UAT documents were moved to:
`archive/obsolete/docs_round2_20260210_183405/docs/QA/`

- `Acceptance_Checklist_2026-02-09.md`
- `UAT_BL-002_to_BL-007.md`
- `UAT_FullChain_Checklist_2026-02-09.md`
- `UAT_FullChain_Defects_2026-02-09.md`

## Archived In Round 3

Historical AI milestone summaries were moved to:
`archive/obsolete/docs_round3_20260210_204843/docs/QA/`

- `AI_Features_Testing_Analysis_2026-02-10.md`
- `P0_AI_Quality_Tests_Summary.md`
- `P1_AI_Benchmark_Infrastructure_Summary.md`
- `P2_Benchmark_Baseline_Summary.md`
- `Agent_Allocation_Fix_Summary.md`

## Evidence Location Rule

- Original runtime paths in old records may still use `.runtime/...` naming.
- Current physical storage after cleanup is under:
  - `archive/generated/cleanup_20260210_173315/.runtime/...`

## Working Rule

- Keep this folder focused on active logs and milestone summaries.
- Archive detailed case docs after closure to keep the main folder readable.
