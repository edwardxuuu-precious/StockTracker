# StockTracker Progress Hub

## Purpose
This folder now keeps only the minimal progress documents needed for daily work.

## Keep And Use
- `docs/README.md`: top-level docs entry.
- `docs/Progress/README.md`: this hub document.
- `docs/Progress/Current_Backlog_2026-02-09.md`: current backlog and status.
- `docs/Progress/Update_Workflow.md`: how to update progress docs consistently.
- `docs/HANDOFF_TO_CODEX_2026-02-10.md`: current full handoff and project snapshot.

## Archived In Round 2
The following historical progress files were moved to:
`archive/obsolete/docs_round2_20260210_183405/docs/Progress/`

- `Blueprint.md`
- `Current_Backlog_2026-02-07.md`
- `Current_Backlog_2026-02-08.md`
- `Div_Progress_Goal1.md`
- `Div_Todo_Goal2.md`
- `Master_Plan.md`
- `Master_Progress.md`
- `ProjectCleanerSkill.md`
- `Stop_Doing.md`

## Working Rule
- Add new progress updates to `Current_Backlog_2026-02-09.md`.
- If a new day backlog is created, keep only the latest one in this folder and archive older ones.
- Keep this folder as the entrypoint only; move deep history to `archive/obsolete/`.
